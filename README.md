VR simulation where you race against a pathfinding agent.

People who look at path finding agents see it through the scope of God.
They themselves can see the whole map and have all the information while the agent doesn't.
This makes it hard to really understand what the agent can and cannot do.
This simulation puts the person in the agent's perspective and has them compete against A*.

This project is made using unity.
